# High Quality Rip Explainer Extension

This is a simple browser extension that gets the joke of the current [SiIvaGunner](https://www.youtube.com/c/SiIvaGunner) high quality rip you're listening to. Simply navigate to the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) page of the rip, click on the icon and hit the "Get the Joke" button. This will open the [SiIvaGunner wiki](https://siivagunner.fandom.com/wiki/SiIvaGunner_Wiki) article of the rip, allowing you to see the joke in the "Joke" or "Jokes" section of the article. Currently, the extension is only avaliable on Google Chrome.\*

## FAQ

### SiIva what now?

Check [this video](https://youtu.be/_NFate6AfzU) out ;)

### It says "There is currently no text in this page."?

Looks like no one's documented the joke yet. This usually happens for rips that have recently been uploaded. Try again in a day or so. If you know the joke, [why not document it yourself](https://siivagunner.fandom.com/wiki/SiIvaGunner_Wiki:Manual_of_Style/Rips)?

### It says "Bad title"?

This happens when the title of a rip contains characters that are not allowed in FANDOM wiki article titles. Try removing strange characters from the URL or changing square brackets into regular brackets. I'll release an update shortly to address this. [See here](https://siivagunner.fandom.com/wiki/SiIvaGunner_Wiki:Manual_of_Style/Rips#Other_Considerations:_Invalid_Rip_Titles) for more information.

### I'm certain that I'm on the SiIvaGunner channel but the extension says I'm not on it. What gives?

The channel's name has probably been changed temporarily. This may occur (abit rarely) on special events. You'll just have to wait, I'm afraid.
